Hello, world! Welcome to the world of Java programming.
Numbers like 123 or 4567 should not be counted as words.
Let's test some edge cases:
- Short words: a, an, the, it, and, or
- Long words: programming, Java, exceptional
- Mixed case: Java, java, JAVA
- Punctuation: testing, punctuation! should, be, handled.
- Contractions: don't, can't, it's, doesn't

Make sure to verify that "123" and "4567" are not counted.
Check that "Hello" and "hello" are treated as the same word.
Ensure that short words (3 or fewer letters) are not counted.
